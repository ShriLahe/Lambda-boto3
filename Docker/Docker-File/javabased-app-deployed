To build a Docker image from this Dockerfile, navigate to the directory containing the Dockerfile and run the following command:
#docker build -t my-application-app .
This will create a Docker image with the tag my-application-image based on the instructions in the Dockerfile.

Once the image is built, you can run a container using the image with the following command:
#docker run my-application-app
This will start a container from the image, and your Java application will run inside the container.
